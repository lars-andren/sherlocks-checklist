Checklist for ruling out everything but the impossible.

"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?"
- Sherlock Holmes, The Sign of Four (1890)

Even with the help of IDEs there will be situations when the Unit Test fails, when the database manager can't connect, or the damn thing just won't do what it's supposed to. At such times you might end up in a loop of "this is impossible", and keep staring at the same lines of code that simply won't work, even though they are perfect.

This is when you need a checklist of things to verify, please see the wiki!
